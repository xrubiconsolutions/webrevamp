      <BodyP>
        3.1 If you schedule for a collection service and the collector accept to
        undertake the schedule pickup, then the collection service is considered
        to have been ordered.
      </BodyP>

        situation where the collector has replied to your request and you
        subsequently reject, cancel, or refuse the collection service. When a
        collection service request is cancelled in the above scenario the
        generator may pay for such cancellation in future collection .
      </BodyP>
      <BodyP>
        3.3 If you cancel a collection service request on multiple occasions, we
        may temporarily block your account for warning. After multiple such
        warnings, we may suspend your account for longer period (e.g 12 months).
        After that period you could ask to reactivate your account and your
        application will be reviewed by Pakam.

        pickup location and generator for whom the collection was ordered do not
        submit is or her waste within a certain period as specified in the Pakam

        collector may decide to cancel your schedule request, please note that
        Pakam is not responsible for such situations.
      </BodyP>
      <BodyP>
        3.5 Once the collector arrives and sends you a notification that he/she
        has arrived It is expected that the generator will bring out his or her
        sorted waste for the collector. In a situation the generator is not
        around, the waste should be handed over to someone within the household.
        It should be noteworthy that collectors are not to be allowed to enter
        generators household and allowing collector into the household is not
        Pakam transaction and such shall be bored by the household should any
        complaint arise. Collectors are not to sort household waste for them. It
        is expected that household has sorted their waste before scheduling for
        pickup or drop off. If waste is not sorted, the generator shall pay the
        collector a mutually agreed cash for performing such task on-behave of
        the generator. Otherwise, collector shall collect the waste and shall
